# Review: CS7637 Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence
## Objective
The objective was to take an introductory course in the field of Artificial Intelligence before immersing myself into the heavier CS6601 Artificial Intelligence course. 
## Learning Outcome
It was an eye opening experience to work on various projects related to Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence. Before taking this course, I would not have expected that these concepts were considered AI. Some of the interesting assignments that we completed included:
- **Guards and Prisoners**: A smart generate and test AI agent that tries and eliminate possible outcomes to reach the end goal.
- **Sentence Reading**: A simple language interpreting AI agent that derives meaning from a text using known language concepts like Subject, Verb, Agreement.
- **Raven's Progressive Matrices**: An AI agent that looks at the patterns for an IQ test and tries to find the right answer to the question. 

This course provided opportunities for us to work on different knowledge-based AI related problems and taught us the thought process behind creating the solutions to these problems. 

The course has made me slightly more confident in taking the CS6601 Artificial Intelligence course, which is one of the requirements for the Interactive Intelligence specialization. 

## Difficulty
This course required consistent effort. I spent approximately **10 - 20 hours** each week on the course. Weeks that required working on programming assignments took more time.
